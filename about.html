      <h2>Why “Sloths” Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Sloths are often misunderstood as slow. In reality, they are highly efficient, selective,
        and deliberate animals, adapted to operate in complex environments with minimal wasted effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        They conserve energy, ignore noise, and move only when it matters — a philosophy that mirrors
        how effective data and AI systems should work.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>What we learn from sloths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not every signal deserves action</li>
        <li>Efficiency matters more than speed</li>
        <li>Good decisions come from clarity, not urgency</li>
        <li>Systems should adapt to their environment, not fight it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In data and AI, moving fast without understanding often leads to fragile models, noisy dashboards,
        and poor decisions. Sloths remind us that deliberate thinking produces better outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>Our purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Sloths Intel exists to help organisations make confident decisions from imperfect, real-world data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with businesses where data is messy, incomplete, or siloed; teams are busy and resource-constrained;
        and decisions matter more than technical novelty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus is not on building the most complex models, but on building the right intelligence for the decision at hand.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>What makes our approach different</h2>
      <p>
        We take a hybrid AI approach — combining statistical modelling, machine learning, domain knowledge,
        and human judgement — to balance accuracy, interpretability, and practicality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients understand why a recommendation exists, not just what it says. We prioritise transparency over black-box systems,
        usefulness over sophistication, and long-term reliability over short-term performance.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>Who we work with</h2>
      <p>
        We partner with small and medium businesses, local service providers, creative and professional teams,
        and organisations without large in-house data teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our tools and advisory work are designed to fit real constraints — limited time, limited data, and the need
        for decisions that can be explained and defended.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>The Sloths Intel promise</h2>
      <p>We don’t rush to automate. We don’t chase trends. We don’t overload teams with dashboards.</p>
      <p>Instead, we design calm, deliberate intelligence that helps people see clearly, decide confidently, and act when it truly matters.</p>
